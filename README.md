# amazon-reviews

Amazon is one of the leading e-commerce companies in the world.  Amazon has millions of products listed on their site, this information overload makes it difficult for customers to find the right products.  Recommendation systems solve this issue by suggesting the most relevant products to each customer.  This in turn reduces churn and increases sales for Amazon, ensuring that Amazon stays ahead of competitors and becomes even more profitable. 

Like most e-commerce companies, Amazon has the functionality that allows itâ€™s customers to review products they have purchased. I will utilize this data along with metadata for the magazine subscriptions category within Amazon to generate magazine recommendations (based on similar customers as well as similar products) for Amazon customers. 

This project encapsulates data wrangling (pandas, numpy), data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), data exploration, collaborative filtering recommendation systems (Python - surprise & PySpark), content-based filtering recommendation system (sklearn - cosine similarity), model evaluation and data storytelling.
