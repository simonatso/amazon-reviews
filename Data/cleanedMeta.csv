Gray's has a reputation as an exhilarating, compelling and beautiful publication. More than just a how-to hunting and fishing handbook, Gray's provides the reader with a deep personal satisfaction of the sporting experience through its absorbing literature, exciting photographic essays and fine sporting and wildlife art. Published 7 times per year."", '<I>Gray\'s Sporting Journal</I> is one of the hidden gems of sporting and wildlife magazines. Consider the publication values: photographic essays (on drift boating, for example, or trap shooting in Europe) are part of every issue and are always very well done; the pages are glossy, thick and substantial; there\'s art (usually a painting) in the back of each issue; you\'ll often find a poem tucked away in its 150-plus pages; and there are fewer advertisements here than you\'ll see in a <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005N7Q5/${0}"">Field & Stream</a></I>. But what makes it most difficult to send an issue to the recycling bin is the writing, which is of a depth, breadth, and quality that you will be hard-pressed to find in any other outdoor magazine. The source of this writing helps to account for its value--specifically, it comes from all corners, including university professors who find meaning in the outdoors and their interaction with it, and people who were obviously hunting and fishing long before many people were born. But no matter whether the story you\'re reading seems to emanate from a campfire or a classroom, the writing itself is almost always engaging. Some will find that the combination of high art and the advertisements for exclusive game ranches makes the publication feel too much like you\'re sipping cognac in a leather chair in your library. The writing, however, is never so stuffy, and stays firmly rooted to the outdoors that inspire it.']",,Morris Communications Corp.,B00005Q7E3

Each issue covers a wide range of scientific topics, including recent research developments in biology, chemistry, psychology, physics, geology, and technology. <br /><br /> All of the articles in American Scientist magazine are written by scientists and engineers, and the magazine is published by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, so you can trust the veracity of the content. The photographs, charts, and diagrams that accompany articles make the subjects accessible even to those with little familiarity with the given topic and add depth to the knowledge of those familiar with the material. However, the majority of the content is aimed at those with a background in general science, so readers with little scientific training may find the articles a bit technical. <br /><br /> Regular columns in American Scientist magazine highlight modern scientists' diverse viewpoints regarding the process of science. Personal essays on the intersection of science and computing, cutting-edge and controversial science, and the future of scientific research allow you a glimpse into the minds of people actively working in the field. Book reviews help you narrow down your reading list, while insightful cartoons keep you smiling even on days when your own research isn't living up to your expectations. <br /><br /> Whether you are a professional scientist interested in keeping up with discoveries in different fields or a student who simply likes to explore the world in greater depth, American Scientist magazine can give you a greater appreciation for modern science and technology.""]",,American Scientist,B00006K3EU

It retains the character of a book review, published 20 times a year. But since its inception over 30 years ago, the reviews have been long, dense (recent years have brought the practice of footnotes), and learned. Significant fiction is pondered, along with bits of poetry, slices of science, and gobs of political science, history, economics, biography, art, and music. The reader of the <I>New York Review</I> easily feels relieved of the cultural burden of having to read a book once having completed the sufficient burden of having read a thorough review of it. Although the impeccably left-leaning editors would be loathe to agree, only major figures or discourses in the European intellectual tradition need apply to their pages for consideration. Hence, for example, although occasional ""pieces"" on certain worthy movies now appear, popular culture is not a serious concern. Lately, the <I>Review</I> has given over more of its pages (from 60 to 80 each issue) to journalistic reports--the latest political currents in China or Russia, the state of affairs in Kurdistan or at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay. Its core identity remains, however, that of a magazine unequaled for addressing intellectual ""issues""--Darwin under attack again, pedophilia continuing in the Church, whither globalization--through reviewing them as these issues appear in book form. <I>--Terry Caesar</I>']",,New York Review of Books,B00007G2SO

Corporate power and public policy were colluding in the destruction of the family farm, and the process of annihilation was gathering speed. Walters met, interviewed and presented to the public the works of soil scientists, farmers, economic thinkers and farm policy experts who were gradually being pushed aside by mainstream publications in favor of more modern, and more toxic, solutions. He worked tirelessly to reveal the inadequacies of chemical farming, and promoted gently coaxing nature into yielding her bounty.', 'Decades later, <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> readers continue to receive the latest news and in-depth analyses of ecological agriculture technologies, economic issues and environmental news each month. They meet successful eco-farmers through case reports. Top figures in eco-agriculture share their stories, struggles and successes through the <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> Interview. And eco-agriculture is brought full-circle through countless discussions of complex veterinary and human health and healing issues. Add in regular columns on marketing, grazing, tillage methods, soils, weed and insect control, high-value crops, news from around the world, meetings, and more, and youll begin to understand the scope of what <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> offers.', ""Based on the work of scientists and farmers whose sophisticated approach to agriculture reveals chemical farming as obsolete and misguided, <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> teaches readers how to embrace the science of nature. Rather than batter nature into submission with bizarre chemistry that short-circuits natural processes, sustainable farmers feed the soil and bring it into balance. Subsequently, they are rewarded with superior crops and lower input costs. <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> has helped thousands of farmers feed the nation's growing appetite for clean, delicious food and showed them how to make a profit while they're at it."", '<i>Acres U.S.A.</i> holds a unique understanding of and role in the eco-agriculture movement, introducing readers to the experts who are putting both new practices and proven methods to work in the field.

In 1987 it was on only its second editor when management decided to shake things up. A rocky decade ensued, but <i>The New Yorker</i> is now back at the top of its game under David Remnick\'s editorship. Each issue offers commentaries and reporting on politics, culture, and events, with a focus that\'s both national and international; humor and cartoons; fiction and poetry; and reviews of books, movies, theater, music, art, and fashion. Several times a year special issues focus on a theme--music, fashion, business. The writing is mostly first-rate, frequently coming from top literary and journalistic talents. <i>The New Yorker</i>\'s weekly issues can seem overwhelming--so much good stuff to read, piling up so fast!--but it\'s as easy to dip in for a small snack as it is to wade in for a substantial meal.<i> --Nicholas H.
