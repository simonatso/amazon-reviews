Amazon.com Review  Glamour is the twentysomething woman\\'s \"Miss Manners\" and charm-school bible, bursting at the seams with intimations, propositions, and warnings: how to dress for a dinner party, how to turn him on in five minutes, how to avoid the dreaded \"fashion don\\'t.\" Glamour\\'s mission is to help the young woman trapped between Seventeen and Vogue find her way to becoming a happier, healthier, sexier gal. Unabashedly girly, including all the things we\\'ve come to expect from beauty and fashion mags--celebrity style gossip, hot trends in hair and makeup, quizzes, and quick fixes for everything from broken nails to fractured friendships--Glamour is girl talk, pure and simple. --Daphne Durham   ']</td>\n",

Amazon.com Review  Glamour is the twentysomething woman\\'s \"Miss Manners\" and charm-school bible, bursting at the seams with intimations, propositions, and warnings: how to dress for a dinner party, how to turn him on in five minutes, how to avoid the dreaded \"fashion don\\'t.\" Glamour\\'s mission is to help the young woman trapped between Seventeen and Vogue find her way to becoming a happier, healthier, sexier gal. Unabashedly girly, including all the things we\\'ve come to expect from beauty and fashion mags--celebrity style gossip, hot trends in hair and makeup, quizzes, and quick fixes for everything from broken nails to fractured friendships--Glamour is girl talk, pure and simple. --Daphne Durham   ']   \n",
